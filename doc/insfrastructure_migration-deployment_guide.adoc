== Infrastructure Migration 1.1 beta - Deployment Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

The field experience in migrating VMs from propietary virtualization infrastructures to Red Hat infrastructure providers has been completed in several customized engagements. From the experience of these engagements and with the involvement of Engineering and User Experience and Design teams, a productized version of it is built, and included in the environment provided for this guide.

This guide intends to provide the information needed to perform a successful deployment of the Infrastructure Migration solution.
For the *official Infrastructure Migration Solution 1.0 documentation* please go link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_infrastructure_migration_solution/1.0/html-single/infrastructure_migration_solution_guide/index[here]

The password to access all services is available link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1174612-accessing-red-hat-solutions-lab-in-rhpds[here].

[WARNING] 
This guide will not work properly in an environment previously used for the Infrastructure Migration Lab. A fresh new environment needs to be requested to follow this guide

== VM Migration Workflow

image::migration_workflow.png[VM Migration Workflow]


. The Infrastructure Admin creates an *infrastructure mapping* and a virtual machine *migration plan* in CloudForms, and runs the migration plan.

. CloudForms locates the virtual machines to be migrated based on the *infrastructure mapping*.

. The ESXi host fingerprint is captured for authentication during the conversion process if the VDDK transport method is used. If SSH is used, a shared SSH key is used to connect to the ESX host where the virtual machine resides.

. Using the RHV attributes for the target environment, CloudForms *initiates communication* with the RHV *conversion host*.

. The RHV conversion host connects to the *source datastore* through the ESX host, using `virt-v2v-wrapper.py`, and streams the disk to be converted to the *target data domain* chosen in the infrastructure mapping using `virt-v2v`.

. After the *disk is converted*, the target *virtual machine is created* in RHV. During creation, the target virtual machine uses the source virtual machine’s metadata to maintain the virtual machine’s attributes (tags, power state, MAC address, CPU count, memory, disks, and virtual machine name) after migration.

. After the virtual machine is created, the *disk is attached* to the target virtual machine.

. *VM migration is complete*. The status displayed in CloudForms during the whole process.

== Deployment

=== CloudForms Deployment

The environment, as instantiated, is fully configured. In a simulated deployment we will have a predeployed VMware vSphere virtualization environment, and a Red Hat Virtualization environment with, at least one hypervisor running RHEL. 

In this Deployment Lab, a Cloudforms appliance is already provided, so there is no need to deploy one.
As a reference on how to deploy a CloudForms appliance on RHV and vSphere the following official documentation is available: 

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_red_hat_virtualization/[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on Red Hat Virtualization]

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_cloudforms/4.6/html/installing_red_hat_cloudforms_on_vmware_vsphere/[Installing Red Hat CloudForms on VMware vSphere]

Also as a reference on how to configure the environment, the following official documentation is available:

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_infrastructure_migration_solution/1.0/html-single/infrastructure_migration_solution_guide/index[Infrastructure Migration Solution - Official Documentation]

In this lab we will have a CloudForms instance, that was deployed by downloading an appliance image and adding it to the environment.

The environment is completely configured, and an overview look at it, is recommended before starting.

Once the overview is done, we can proceed by running, in `workstation`, the playbook to unconfigure the deployed CloudForms:

----
# cd /root/RHS-Infrastructure_Migration/playbooks/
# ansible-playbook unconfigure.yml 
----

The playbook will stop the CloudForms services, will reset the database, and restart the services. The playbook won't unconfigure `kvm1`, the currently configured conversion host, or the RHV setup.

[NOTE]
Take into account that after CloudForms database reset, the users will be removed and the `admin` will have the *password reset* to the default appliance password (smartvm).

==== Automation domain in CloudForms

TODO: Add a review on the automation domain

==== Add Virtualization Providers

Once CloudForms has been reset to a just installed state, the Virtualization providers have to be added to it. This can be done by login in with the default appliance password, and then following these steps:

. Navigate, in *Cloudforms* to  *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*. Click on *Configuration -> Add a New Infrastructure Provider*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_1.png[Add Providers 1]

. In the page *Add New Infrastructure Provider* type in Name `VMware` and choose in *Type* dropdown menu `VMware vCenter`. Then under *Endpoints* in the space assigned as *Hostname* type `vcenter.example.com`, in *Username* type `root` and in *Password* use the <provided_password>. Click *Validate*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_2.png[Add Providers 2]

. Once validated, a message stating *Credential validation was successful* shall appear. Click *Add*
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_3.png[Add Providers 3]

. This will move to the *Infrastructure providers* page showing a message saying *Infrastructure Provider "VMware" was saved*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_4.png[Add Providers 4]

. Click on *Configuration -> Add a New Infrastructure Provider* again. In the page *Add New Infrastructure Provider* type, this time, Name `RHV` and choose in *Type* dropdown menu `Red Hat Virtualization`. Then under *Endpoints* in the space assigned as *Hostname* type `rhvm.example.com`, deactivate *Verify TLS Certificates*, then in *Username* type `admin@internal` and in *Password* use the <provided_password>. Click *Validate*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_5.png[Add Providers 5]

. Once validated, a message stating *Credential validation was successful* shall appear. Click *Add*
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_6.png[Add Providers 6]

. This will move, again, to the *Infrastructure providers* page showing a message saying *Infrastructure Provider "RHV" was saved*.
+
image::cloudforms_add_providers_7.png[Add Providers 7]

This way the two Virtualization providers are managed by CloudForms. Take some time to navigate the menues under *Compute -> Infrastructure*.

[TIP]
It is recommended to go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers* select both providers and click on *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States* before continuing to have all data from providers updated.

=== Conversion Host Installation

We will use both hypervisors, `kvm1` and `kvm2`, as conversion hosts. Host `kvm1` is already configured. We will proceed to install `kvm2`.

In the `/usr/share/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/playbooks` directory of the RHV Manager, the playbooks to install a conversion host are available:

----
[root@workstation ~]# ssh rhvm
[root@rhvm ~]# cd /usr/share/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/playbooks
----


An inventory file `conversion_hosts_inventory.yml` has to be created, with the following content:

----
all:
  vars:
    v2v_repo_srpms_name: "rhel-7-server-rhv-4-mgmt-agent-source-rpms"
    v2v_repo_srpms_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/rhel-7-server-rhv-4-mgmt-agent-source-rpms"
    v2v_vddk_package_name: "VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
    v2v_vddk_package_url: "http://storage.example.com/repos/VMware-vix-disklib-6.5.2-6195444.x86_64.tar.gz"
  hosts:
    kvm2.example.com:
----

[TIP]
There is already a file created for you in the environment with some extra vars commented. The sample file is also available link:../scripts/conversion_hosts/conversion_hosts_inventory.yml[here]

Then the playbooks are run in the `/usr/share/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/playbooks/` directory of the RHV Manager, `rhvm`.

There is a `conversion_host_check.yml` playbook that can be run and ensures that the installation is OK. You can run it before installing to *see how errors are reported*, as we will be running it on an uninstalled conversion host:

----
# cd /usr/share/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/playbooks/
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=conversion_hosts_inventory.yml conversion_host_check.yml 
----

After that, the installation of tools can be performed by running the `conversion_host_enable.yml` playbook:

----
# pwd 
/usr/share/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/playbooks/
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=conversion_hosts_inventory.yml conversion_host_enable.yml 
----

It may be time to check again and ensure the tool installation went OK:

----
# pwd
/usr/share/ovirt-ansible-v2v-conversion-host/playbooks/
# ansible-playbook --inventory-file=conversion_hosts_inventory.yml conversion_host_check.yml 
----

=== Conversion Host Configuration in CloudForms

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm2*.
+
image::conversion_host_2b.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Select *V2V - Transformation Host* and then select *t* (as true) for the assigned value.
+
image::conversion_host_4.png[Conversion Host 4]
+
image::conversion_host_5.png[Conversion Host 5]
+
* This sets this Host as *Conversion Host*.

. Select the *V2V - Transformation Method* tag and select *VDDK* for the assigned value, then click *Save*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* This sets the method that *Conversion Host* will use to migrate the *VMs*.
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]
+
[NOTE]
You may see the tags added under *Smart Management* in the host page.

. On the `cf` system, go back to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm2* again.
+
image::conversion_host_2b.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item*.
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Fill *Username* with `root` and *Password* with the provided one. Click *Validate*. Once the message "Credential validation was successful" appears click *Save*. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. Now the conversion host is ready.
