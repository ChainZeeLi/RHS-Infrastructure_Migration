== Infrastructure Migration 1.0 GA - Lab Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

This Lab Environment uses Red Hat CloudForms, and the Infrastructure Migration plugin (a.k.a. v2v-plugin), as a broker to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization. 

Please watch this video for an introduction: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh018-virtualization-and-infrastructure-migration-technical-overview[Virtualization and Infrastructure Migration Technical Overview (RH018)]

The password to access all services is available link:https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1174612-accessing-red-hat-solutions-lab-in-rhpds[here]

In this environment the following configuration steps are already done:

* Configure the conversion hosts in the target provider (RHV)
* Provide credentials for virtualization providers and conversion hosts in CloudForms
* Assign tags for the conversion hosts in CloudForms

The providers are:

* Source - VMware vSphere
* Target - Red Hat Virtualization

After this initial step, the resource equivalence between the two providers has to be defined in an *Infrastucture Mapping* including:

* Clusters
* Storage Domains
* Networks

To perform the migration one *Conversion Host* has beeen configured. In this case RHEL hypervisors were used as conversion hosts.

Finally, a *Migration Plan* has to be executed to perform the final migration.

.Goal
* Migrate several VMs from vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization, using Red Hat CloudForms as a broker, with a Red Hat Solution: Infrastructure Migration
+
NOTE: The source VMs are still maintained post migration and are not deleted. This allows for "failback" if a migration failure occurs.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* It takes about 20 ~ 25 minutes for the demo to load completely and become accessible.
** Wait for the full demo to load, even if some of its systems are marked "Up."
* Watch for an email with information about how to access your demo environment.
** Make note of the email's contents: a list of hostnames, IP addresses, and your GUID.
** Whenever you see <YOUR-GUID> in the demo instructions, replace it with the GUID provided in the email.
* You can get real-time updates and status of your demo environment at https://www.opentlc.com/rhpds-status.
====

[TIP]
Be mindful of the runtime of your demo environment! It may take several hours to complete the demo, so you may need to extend the runtime. This is especially important in later steps when you are building virtual machines. For information on how to extend runtime and lifetime, see https://www.opentlc.com/lifecycle.

=== Environment

A full new demo environment is deployed on every request. To make the environment unique a 4 character identifier is assigned to it (i.e. `1e37`), this identifier is referred in this documentation as *YOUR-GUID*.  

The demo environment consists of the following systems:

image::architecture_diagram.png[Architecture Diagram]

[cols="1,1,1,2",options="header"]
|=======
| Hostname | Internal IP | External name | Description
|`workstation.example.com` |`192.168.0.10` | workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com |Jump host and Ansible host

|`vcenter.example.com` |`192.168.0.50` | vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com |VMware vCenter server
|=======

.Prerequisites

* Deployment of the demo environment which includes the following VMs provisioned in the vSphere environment:
** `jboss0` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `jboss1` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `lb` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss Core Service Apache HTTP server configured with mod_cluster to proxy traffic to `jboss0` and `jboss1`
** `db` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running PostgreSQL that the `jboss0` and `jboss1` application servers connect to

* An external service is configured as https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com pointing to the Load Balancer to make the Ticket Monster app accesible.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server using your OPENTLC login name and private SSH key.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh -i /path/to/private_key <YOUR-OpenTLC-USERNAME-redhat.com>@workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

* Example for user 'batman' and GUID '1e37', using the default ssh private key:
+
----
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa batman-redhat.com@workstation-1e37.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using the provided password:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the environment using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers). 
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up. 
This is an example of a success message for the VM jboss0.example.com:
+
----
jboss0.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+ 
To check the infrastructure machines the following command can be also used:
+
----
# ansible infra -m ping
----
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with JBoss Core Services' Apache HTTP + modcluster as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP 7 in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----
+ 

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudForms web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

. Verify that the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
+
image::app-ticketmonster-running.png[Ticket Monster app running]
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
image::ssl_cert_warning.png[SSL Cert Warning]
+
If the ticketmonster app is not running, please run the following command in `workstation`:
+
----
/usr/bin/ansible-playbook /root/RHS-Infrastructure_Migration/playbooks/start_vms.yml --extra-vars @/root/RHS-Infrastructure_Migration/playbooks/vars_vms.yml
----

. Prepare to manage the environment. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.

* *Red Hat Virtualization Manager:* `https://rhvm-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
.. Navigate to and click *Administration Portal* and log in using `admin`, `<to_be_provided>`, and `internal`.
+
image::rhv_login.png[RHV Login]

.. Verify that the Cluster is up and Hypervisors are active
+
[TIP]
As this is nested virtualization, sometimes the CPU type of the hypervisor is changed. 
+
image::rhv_hypervisors_up.png[RHV Hypervisors up]

* *vCenter:* `https://vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::vsphere_web_client_0.png[vCenter Login]

** Flash Player is required.
+
[TIP]
Modern browsers have flash player disabled by default. You  need to enable it to access and use the web manager interface in vSphere 5.5.

* Click on *Log in to vSphere Web Client*
+
image::vsphere_web_client_1.png[vSphere Web Client Login]
+
[WARNING]
Use `root` as the username to log in to vCenter.

* Click *Click on VMs and Templates*.
+
image::vsphere_web_client_2.png[vCenter]

.. Click *VMs and Templates* and verify that the 4 VMs `lb.example.com`, `jboss0.example.com`, `jboss1.example.com` and `db.example.com` are running. 
+
image::vsphere_web_client_3.png[vCenter]


* *CloudForms:* `https://cf-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+

[TIP]
Take into account that vCenter may take longer to start.

. To have proper information on all the resources available, check the provider's box, go to *Configuration -> Refresh Relationships and Power States*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_4.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 4]

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. All VMs, Orphaned VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_2.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 2]
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *VMware* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_3.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 3]

=== Check Conversion Hosts

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm1.example.com*.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Check that *V2V - Transformation Host* has value *t* (for true) and that *V2V - Transformation Method* tag has value *VDDK*. Click *Cancel*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* This values can also be seen in the *Smart Management* box in the host description
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item* (back in `kvm1.example.com`).
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Check that *Username* has `root` and Password is set. You can click *Validate* to verify they are OK then the message "Credential validation was successful" will appear. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. The conversion host is ready.


=== Create an Infrastructure Mapping

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_1.png[Infrastructure Mapping 1]

. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type the name `ticket-monster-mapping` and click *next*.
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the mapping.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_3.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Clusters*, select *Source Cluster* as `vSphere\DC01\Cluster01` and *Target Cluster* as `RHV\CoolDataCenter\TrustedCluster` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Datastores*, and having selected *Cluster01 (TrustedCluster)* as the cluster to work with, select *Source Datastore* as `vSphere\Datastore` and *Target Datastore* as `RHV\VMStorageNFS` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Networks*, and having selected *Cluster01 (TrustedCluster)* as the cluster to work with, select *Source Network* as `vSphere\VM Network` and *Target Network* as `RHV\ovirtmgmt` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *create*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, a message `All mappings in ticket-monster-mapping have been mapped.` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]

In these steps an *Infrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat Virtualization.

=== Create a Migration Plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration*, which is the finishing page from previous step.

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select in the drop down menu the *Infrastructure Mapping* to be used, `ticket-monster-mapping`, add the name `ticket-monster-plan-lb` and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_2.png[Migration Plan 2]
+
[NOTE]
Keeping the default option will take us to the VM menu selector. For massive conversions a CSV file upload can be the right choice.

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *lb* virtual machine, as the one to be migrated.
+
image::migration_plan_3.png[Migration Plan 3]
+
[NOTE]
VM selector has a filter to help find a set of VMs within a long list.

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Advanced Options*, we can assign *Pre* and *Post* migration playbooks to be executed during the migration. We won't use this in this demo. Click *Next*
+
image::migration_plan_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Schedule*, select *Save migration plan to run later*. Click *Create*
+
image::migration_plan_5.png[Migration Plan 5]
+
[NOTE]
The migration plan can be run immediately, by choosing the other option. 

. In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan has been saved` shall appear. Click *Close*.
+
image::migration_plan_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. Back to the migration page we will see how the *Infrastructure Mapping* and *Migration Plan* are ready to be run
+
image::migration_plan_7.png[Migration Plan 7]

=== Launch Migration

. To launch the migration, while in the *Compute -> Migration* page, click on the *Migrate* button in the *ticket-monster-plan-lb*.
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. The migration will get initiated. All data is gathered and preflight checks are executed.
+
image::migration_running_2.png[Migration Running 2]

. The plan gets auto-approved. Migration starts
+
image::migration_running_3.png[Migration Running 3]

. Now the migration is executing. We can see the orchestration process in Cloudforms logs
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
And each VM migration process in the Conversion Host:
+
----
# ssh kvm1.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/vdsm/import/*
----

. CloudForms Migration interface shows migration status too
+
image::migration_running_4.png[Migration Running 4]

. Clicking on the running plan info box will display the detailed info of the status
+
image::migration_running_5.png[Migration Running 5]

. Progress can be followed in this page or in the main Migration page
+
image::migration_running_6.png[Migration Running 6]

. For the time of the migration the load balancer, `lb` will be powered off migrated and then powered on.
+
image::migration_running_7.png[Migration Running 7]

. It is possible to check in *RHV* interface, in *Compute -> Virtual Machines* how the VM gets imported.
+
image::migration_running_8.png[Migration Running 8]

. Once the migration is finishing ...
+
image::migration_running_9.png[Migration Running 9]

. ... the VM gets powered up
+
image::migration_running_10.png[Migration Running 10]
+
image::migration_running_11.png[Migration Running 11]

. The migration gets completed.
+
image::migration_running_12.png[Migration Running 12]

. Let's check if the VMs are up and running using the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----

. It's time to check the *app* running and accesible via the URL https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
+
image::migration_running_14.png[Migration Running 14]

. Migration can be reviewed in the Main Migration page in CloudForms
+
image::migration_running_15.png[Migration Running 15]

. Additionally the migration log can be downloaded and accessed post VM migration. This is useful for troubleshooint errors or just to check the migration details. It's worth nothing that if the migration fails prior to the VM being migrated this log will not be available. To access the log navigate to Completed Plans, and click **Download Log** and then **Migration log** next to the desired VM.
+
image::migration_log_access.png[Migration Log Access]

.. Once the log is downloaded click to open:
+
image::migration_log.png[Migration Log]

. Migrate the remaining application servers and database VMs from VMware to RHV using a CSV file.

.. Download the CSV file from link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Infrastructure_Migration/master/scripts/ticket_monster_migration.csv[here] and save it as `ticket_monster_migration.csv`. Check that the content is the following:
+
image:ticket_monster_csv_file.png[Multiple VM CSV File]
+
[TIP]
CSV file format is specified in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_infrastructure_migration_solution/1.0/html-single/infrastructure_migration_solution_guide/index#Creating_a_Migration_Plan[Official Documentation]

.. Navigate to *Compute -> Migration* and choose *Create Migration Plan*. We will select the same infrastructure mapping previously created, `ticket-monster-mapping`, and select *Import CSV file with a list of VMs to be migrated*. Click *Next*.
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_1.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 1]

.. In the *Import File* step, click on import and select the previously downloaded file `ticket_monster_migration.csv`
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_2.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 2]
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_3.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 3]

.. The VM list will appear in the dialog. It is possible to modify the selection at this step but we will migrate the whole list. Click *Next*
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_4.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 4]

.. In the *Advanced Options* step we will not apply any change. Click *Next*.
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_5.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 5]

.. In the *Schedule* step we will *Save migration plan to run later*. The plan can later on be scheduled or directly run. Click *Next*.
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_6.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 6]

.. *Results* page for the *Plan* will appear. Click *Close*
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_7.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 7]

.. Back to the main *Migration* page, we can schedule or run the plan created. Click *Migrate*
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_8.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 8]

.. The plan will get automatically approved and start immediatelly. The detailed status can be seen by clicking in the plan box. 
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_9.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 9]
+
image::multi_vm_migration_plan_10.png[Multiple VM Migration Plan 10]

.. Once the VMs complete migration verify they are running in RHV via the RHV admin console.
+
image::multi_vm_migration_rhv.png[Multiple VM Migration RHV]

.. Verify that the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
